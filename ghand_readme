#### ATTENSION: pmi.words.vocab is different from counts.words.vocab. There are no counts in pmi.words.vocab.

# counts2pmi:
         parameter: cds: context distribution smoothing.(power(0.75?, 1?))
         'pmi' is a CSR matrix with each element as: #(w, c) * |D| / [#w * #c] (not logged, also not truncated.)

# ppmi
         parameters: 
         - neg(negative sampling, used for shift)
         - w+c, whether use ensemble(not applicable for ppmi)
         - eig: weighted SVD(only used for SVD)
